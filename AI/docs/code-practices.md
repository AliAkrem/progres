# Progres App - Coding Practices and Standards

## Code Style and Formatting

The Progres application adheres to Flutter's recommended code style guidelines:

- Line length limited to 80 characters where practical
- Consistent use of 2-space indentation
- Usage of trailing commas for better diffs and formatting
- Proper code formatting using `flutter format`

## Widget Structure

### Composition Over Inheritance

The application favors composition over inheritance for widgets:

- Small, single-purpose widgets that can be composed
- Stateless widgets preferred where state is not needed
- Extracting reusable widgets to dedicated files

### Widget Organization

Widgets are organized following these principles:
- Constructor and properties at the top
- Private methods in the middle
- Build method at the bottom
- Clear separation between widget definition and implementation

```dart
class CustomWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  final String title;
  final VoidCallback onTap;

  const CustomWidget({
    Key? key, 
    required this.title, 
    required this.onTap,
  }) : super(key: key);

  Widget _buildHeader() {
    // Implementation
  }

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Column(
      children: [
        _buildHeader(),
        // Other children
      ],
    );
  }
}
```

## State Management

### BLoC Pattern Implementation

- Events are immutable and extend `Equatable`
- States are immutable and extend `Equatable`
- BLoCs handle business logic and emit states
- UI reacts to state changes

### Best Practices

- Keep BLoCs focused on a single feature
- Use proper event and state naming
- Handle edge cases and loading states
- Properly handle errors and edge cases

## Async Operations

- Use `async`/`await` for better readability
- Handle errors using try/catch
- Show loading indicators for long operations
- Cancel operations when no longer needed

## Repository Layer

- Clear interface definitions
- Implementation classes follow interface contracts
- Error handling at the repository level
- Mapping between API responses and domain models

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Test BLoCs for correct state transitions
- Test repositories for correct data handling
- Mock dependencies for isolated testing

### Widget Tests

- Test widget rendering and behavior
- Test user interactions
- Verify correct state handling

## Documentation

- Meaningful comments for complex logic
- Documentation for public APIs
- Clear naming that reduces the need for comments
- Usage examples for complex components

## Performance Considerations

- Minimize unnecessary rebuilds
- Use const constructors where possible
- Lazy loading for expensive operations
- Avoid heavy operations on the main thread

## Resource Management

- Properly dispose controllers and streams
- Close connections when no longer needed
- Cancel subscriptions in widget's dispose method

## Dependency Management

- Precise versioning in pubspec.yaml
- Minimal external dependencies
- Regular updates of dependencies

## Localization and Internationalization

- All user-facing strings are internationalized
- Support for RTL layouts
- Proper handling of different date and number formats

## Accessibility

- Semantic labels for important UI elements
- Proper contrast ratios
- Support for screen readers
- Support for different text sizes
